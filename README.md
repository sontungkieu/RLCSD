# RLCSD: Reinforcement Learning with Contrastive On-Policy Self-Distillation

[![Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-A42C25?style=for-the-badge&logo=arxiv&logoColor=white)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.11709)  [![Dataset](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dataset-%23FFD14D?style=for-the-badge&logo=huggingface&logoColor=black)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Leyiii/RLCSD)

On-policy self-distillation (OPSD) gives reasoning models dense, token-level
supervision by aligning a model's own distribution with the distribution it
produces under a privileged context (typically a verified solution). We show
that this distributional gap is dominated by **style tokens** rather than
**task-bearing tokens** — a pathology we call *privilege-induced style drift*,
which destabilizes training and collapses response length.

**RLCSD** removes this drift by **contrasting the teacher–student gap under a
correct hint against the gap under a *wrong* hint** produced under an identical
prompt template. The shared stylistic component cancels in the subtraction,
leaving a token-level signal that is more concentrated on task-bearing tokens.
We then integrate this signal into GRPO as a verifier-anchored modulation of
the outcome advantage, instead of a replacement for it. On Qwen3 (1.7B / 4B /
8B) and Olmo-3-7B-Think, across DeepMath (AMC23 / AIME24 / AIME25) and Knights
& Knaves, RLCSD **consistently outperforms GRPO and every prior OPSD baseline
we tested**, while keeping training dynamics stable where existing methods
either explode or collapse.

## Method overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/method_pipeline.png" width="95%" alt="RLCSD three-stage pipeline"/>
</p>

For each query we run three stages:

1. **Rollout sampling and partitioning.** Sample G rollouts from the student
   and split them into a correct set 𝒢⁺ and an incorrect set 𝒢⁻ using a
   rule-based verifier (binary reward).
2. **Contrastive token-level signal.** Draw a positive hint y\*<sub>c</sub> from
   𝒢⁺ and *K* negative hints {y\*<sub>w,k</sub>} from 𝒢⁻, wrap each in an
   identical "Reference Solution" template, and form

   ```
   e_ctr,t = log π_T(y_t | x, y*_c, y_<t) − log (1/K) Σ_k π_T(y_t | x, y*_{w,k}, y_<t)
   ```

   Two refinements matter: (i) **K-marginalize the negative branch** to stay
   robust against error-type mismatch between the target rollout and the
   sampled negative, and (ii) **exclude the target rollout from the hint
   pool** to avoid self-conditioning over-confidence.
3. **Verifier-anchored modulation & two-path loss.** Convert e<sub>ctr,t</sub>
   into a bounded modulation r<sub>t</sub> via a tanh squash, gate it with a
   threshold mask, and add it to A<sub>ORM</sub> under a sign-preserving clamp
   so the verifier always decides the update direction. Aggregate as a two-
   path PPO-style clipped loss with independent normalization for unmodulated
   and modulated token sets.

See the paper for derivations of (1)–(3) and ablations on each
design choice.

## Methods supported in this repo

Each YAML config selects a method via the `method:` key. Implementations live in
`third_party/verl/verl/trainer/ppo/core_algos.py` (loss) and
`src/self_distill_main.py` (RLCSD/ECTR rollout-side data path).

## Install

```bash
# Recommended: a fresh Python 3.10–3.12 env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A few practical notes:

- `requirements.txt` pins `torch>=2.5.0,<2.10` to keep a CUDA 12 toolchain.
  torch 2.10+ defaults to CUDA 13 wheels which require a newer NVIDIA driver
  than CUDA 12.x systems ship. For an explicit CUDA match install from the
  PyTorch index:
  ```bash
  pip install "torch>=2.5.0,<2.10" --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
  ```
- `flash-attn` builds against the installed torch — use
  `pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation` if pip's build env can't find torch.
- `third_party/verl/` is added to `PYTHONPATH` automatically by `_run_verl.sh`.

## Data

Training and eval parquets live at
[Leyiii/RLCSD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Leyiii/RLCSD). Pull everything
in one shot:

```bash
python scripts/download_data.py --all
```

This writes to `data/verl/<dataset>/{train,val}.parquet`. The launcher resolves
paths under that root.

| Dataset                              | Used by                            |

Training data subsets come from filtering
[DeepMath-103K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zwhe99/DeepMath-103K)
([He et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11456)) by difficulty band.
The Knights & Knaves generator follows
[Logic-RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14768) (Xie et al., 2025).

## Run

```bash
# RLCSD on Qwen3-4B, math reasoning
bash scripts/math_deepmath/run_qwen3_4b_rlcsd.sh

# SDPO baseline on Olmo3-7B-Think, logic puzzles
bash scripts/logic_kk/run_olmo3_7b_think_sdpo.sh
```

Each shim is a one-liner that forwards a config to `scripts/_run_verl.sh`. To
override individual hyperparameters, append Hydra-style overrides:

```bash
bash scripts/math_deepmath/run_qwen3_4b_rlcsd.sh learning_rate=2e-6 group_size=16
```

The launcher auto-detects `n_gpus_per_node` from the runtime environment when
the config omits it, and uses it with `vllm_tensor_parallel_size` to size rollout
batches. Override it explicitly on constrained nodes, e.g. `n_gpus_per_node=2`.

Common environment overrides:

- `HF_ENDPOINT` — e.g. `https://hf-mirror.com` for a HuggingFace mirror
- `CUDA_HOME` — defaults to `/usr/local/cuda`
- `VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND` — defaults to `FLASH_ATTN` to avoid vLLM
  auto-selecting FlashInfer on Blackwell GPUs; set `vllm_attention_backend=None`
  on the launcher command line to let vLLM choose automatically.

Training logs are local by default. Each run writes TensorBoard events under
`outputs/<project>/<experiment>/<timestamp>/tensorboard_log/` and scalar JSONL
metrics to `metrics.jsonl` in the same run directory. To inspect all local
runs:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir outputs --host 127.0.0.1 --port 6006
```

## Results

### Main results across model scales

RLCSD attains the strongest average performance in every model block and wins
most individual benchmarks across Qwen3 scales and Olmo-3-7B. The gains over the
Base model average **+4.3** (math) and **+10.9** (logic) at 1.7B; **+2.5** /
**+6.8** at 4B; **+2.7** / **+14.4** at 8B; and **+1.8** / **+9.9** on
Olmo-3-7B. The advantage is especially pronounced on the OOD Knights & Knaves
splits (**+21.0** on 11-role at 8B; **+13.0** on 11-role with Olmo-3-7B),
suggesting the cleaned token-level signal improves generalization rather than
just fitting the training task difficulty.

### Training stability

Existing OPSD methods exhibit two characteristic failure modes:

- **Entropy explosion → training collapse.** OPSD, SDPO, and SRPO produce
  rapidly growing actor entropy that destabilizes optimization and manifests as
  abrupt response-length blow-up and sharp drops in reward and validation
  accuracy.
- **Premature length shrinkage.** RLSD steadily decreases response length on
  math, limiting late-stage performance on long-horizon problems.

RLCSD keeps both entropy and response length stable throughout training while
achieving stronger final validation performance:

### Contrastive hints as a plug-in component

The contrastive construction is not specific to RLCSD. Applying it on top of
two representative methods from different families — OPSD (dense distillation)
and RLSD (advantage modulation) — improves **every** method on nearly every
metric.

Concretely, for each method we vary only the source of the privileged signal
and hold everything else fixed:

1. **Dataset CoT** — privileged context is the ground-truth solution from the
   dataset (the original setting in each method's paper).
2. **Own correct rollout** — privileged context is a correct rollout sampled
   by the model itself from the same group.
3. **Own rollout + contrast** — the contrastive construction (correct rollout
   vs. incorrect sibling rollout). This is what `*_ectr` and `rlcsd` use.

Settings (1) and (2) perform essentially the same across all three methods —
switching the *source* of the one-sided hint barely matters. Setting (3) is
the one that wins. Δ below is the **gain of (3) over the better of (1) and
(2)**, averaged across benchmarks (Math = AMC23 + AIME24 + AIME25 mean@12,
KK = 4–8 + 9 + 10 + 11 pass@1, Qwen3-4B):

|  Method | Δ (Math avg) | Δ (KK avg) |
|---------|-------------:|-----------:|
| OPSD    | **+0.2**     | **+2.3**   |
| RLSD    | **+2.2**     | **+1.0**   |
| RLCSD   | **+3.0**     | **+5.4**   |

**`opsd_ectr` — OPSD + contrastive token-level signal.** Without contrast,
OPSD's actor entropy explodes in the late stage (the failure mode above);
adding the contrastive hint keeps entropy bounded and yields a stable training
reward.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/opsd_ectr_effect.png" width="80%" alt="OPSD-ECTR mitigates entropy explosion"/>
</p>

**`rlsd_ectr` — RLSD + contrastive evidence ratio.** The contrastive signal
mitigates the length collapse seen in vanilla RLSD on math (left panel below).
The right panel is an **RLCSD ablation**: removing the contrast from RLCSD
reproduces the same length-collapse pathology, confirming that the contrastive
construction is what keeps RLCSD's reasoning traces from shrinking.

These plug-in results are reported only on Qwen3-4B in the paper, and only
those configs ship here (`configs/{math_deepmath,logic_kk}/qwen3_4b_opsd_ectr.yaml`
and `qwen3_4b_rlsd_ectr.yaml`).

## Built on verl

The vendored fork under `third_party/verl/` is based on
[verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) ([Sheng et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19256)).
RLCSD-specific extensions live in:

- `third_party/verl/verl/trainer/ppo/core_algos.py` — new policy losses
  registered via `@register_policy_loss("rlcsd" | "opsd_ectr" | "rlsd_ectr")`
- `third_party/verl/verl/workers/{actor,utils}/` — minor plumbing for the
  positive/negative teacher batches required by the RLCSD data path
